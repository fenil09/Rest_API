Http Headers and Status codes.

-> Headers basically can be seen as the extra information that is been attached with the request and response.
The information would be like how much data does the packet contains, where was the request coming from, where it needs
to get etc..

-> They would be consisting of all the meta-deta that would be associated with the 
request and the response.


// One of the best practice is that when we are creating the custom headers we need to write X before the 
name of the header, so that we we can know about that header being the custom one.


Status Code HTTP:

Status code would be indicatting whether a request has been successfully
completed or not.  

// Let us say that our request was successfull, then we would be
getting the status code to be 200. Now the best practice over here,
according to the standards is that when we are making an post request it is better
to send the status code of 201 which shows that a new entity was 
created.
