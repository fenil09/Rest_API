// we are Desigining a rest api.

1. to get all the data of the users so the first main route would be
GET / users -> list all the users.
GET /users/1 -> getting the user having ID 1

POST/user -> Creating a new user.
PATCH /user/1 -> it would edit the user with ID1

DELETE /users/1


-> Now when we are trying to get a particular user the userid parameter would be changing
so we need to setup dynamic routing parameters.

app.get("/users/:id",function(request,response){
    const id = Number(request.params.id);
    const user = users.find(user => user.id === id);
    response.send(user);
})

-> Let us understand here so first we need to get the id of which we want the record.
so we would storing that Id in a variable called id, as it is a string we would be converting that string
into a number cause we would be performing a match logic for which the id should be a number
Secondly we would be finding a user whose ID would be matching the ID we have passed in our request parameter.
example /users/1 -> so if it would find a user whose ID is 1 and if we found one we would return that user.
